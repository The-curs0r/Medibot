Hypothermia is a medical emergency that occurs when your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat, causing a dangerously low body temperature. Normal body temperature is around 98.6 F (37 C). Hypothermia (hi-poe-THUR-me-uh) occurs as your body temperature falls below 95 F (35 C).

When your body temperature drops, your heart, nervous system and other organs can't work normally. Left untreated, hypothermia can eventually lead to complete failure of your heart and respiratory system and eventually to death.

Hypothermia is often caused by exposure to cold weather or immersion in cold water. Primary treatments for hypothermia are methods to warm the body back to a normal temperature.

Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold.

The most common symptoms of hypothermia include excessive shivering, slowed breathing, slowed speech, clumsiness, stumbling, confusion

Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of 36.5–37.5 °C (97.7–99.5 °F) through thermoregulation.

Efforts to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing.

Diagnosis:

The diagnosis of hypothermia is usually apparent based on a person's physical signs and the conditions in which the person with hypothermia became ill or was found. Blood tests also can help confirm hypothermia and its severity.

A diagnosis may not be readily apparent, however, if the symptoms are mild, as when an older person who is indoors has symptoms of confusion, lack of coordination and speech problems.Depending on the severity of hypothermia, emergency medical care for hypothermia may include one of the following interventions to raise the body temperature:

• Passive rewarming : For someone with mild hypothermia, it is enough to cover them with heated blankets and offer warm fluids to drink.

• Blood rewarming : Blood may be drawn, warmed and recirculated in the body. A common method of warming blood is the use of a hemodialysis machine, which is normally used to filter blood in people with poor kidney function. Heart bypass machines also may need to be used.

• Warm intravenous fluids : A warmed intravenous solution of salt water may be put into a vein to help warm the blood.

• Airway rewarming : The use of humidified oxygen administered with a mask or nasal tube can warm the airways and help raise the temperature of the body.

• Irrigation : A warm saltwater solution may be used to warm certain areas of the body, such as the area around the lungs (pleura) or the abdominal cavity (peritoneal cavity). The warm liquid is introduced into the affected area with catheters.
